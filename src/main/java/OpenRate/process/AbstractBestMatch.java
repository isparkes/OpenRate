 * does not need to be registered as transaction bound. Recall that we will
 * only need to be transaction aware when we need some specific information
 * from the transaction management (e.g. the base file name) or when we
 * require to have the possibility to undo transaction work in the case of
 * some failure.
 *
 * In this case we do not need it, as the input and output adapters will roll
 * the information back for us (by removing the output stream) in the case of
 * an error.
